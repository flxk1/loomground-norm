"""Phase-2 rule extraction — the LLM seam, gated like everything else.

Phase-1 (``rule_extractor``) is regex over single sentences; contracts break
it with multi-sentence rules, embedded definitions, and defined-term
subjects. Phase-2 hands those harder reads to a language model — ANY model,
local or cloud, injected as ``model_fn(prompt) -> str`` (the same pattern as
``reasoning_walker``) — under three non-negotiables:

  1. **Strict output contract.** The model returns JSON rules with the same
     five slots Phase-1 produces. Anything that does not parse as the schema
     is DROPPED with a recorded repair note — a malformed model reply is an
     abstention, never a fabricated rule.
  2. **Same gates.** Phase-2 facets carry ``extractor='phase-2-llm'`` and a
     capped confidence (never above 0.85 — model output starts at the floor,
     it does not get to outrank deterministic extraction); predicate structs
     still come from the deterministic parser only.
  3. **Defined-term resolution is grounded.** The model may use the defined-
     terms registry given to it, and each resolved subject must literally be
     a registered term — a subject resolved to an unregistered name is kept
     as written and flagged, not trusted.

Pure stdlib; no model dependency — tests inject stubs.
