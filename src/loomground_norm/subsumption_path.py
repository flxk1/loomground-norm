"""Subsumption path — multi-hop made explicit, with the five gaps surfaced.

`reasoning.compose_paths` is edge composition: necessary, not sufficient. The
essay wants *more* — the legal-shaped chain rendered as an artifact:

    Norm → Tatbestand → Ausnahme → Auslegung → Subsumtion → Ergebnis

and, at each hop, the five failure modes made visible instead of smoothed:

    retrieval gap  — a required link in the chain is missing entirely;
    context  gap  — a link is present only partially (excerpt, not full);
    reasoning gap  — present but no edge connects it into the chain;
    conflict gap  — two sources disagree (older vs newer; O vs F);
    authority gap  — links of mixed authority with no precedence resolved.

This module assembles the chain from typed atoms (+ optional reasoning edges) and
returns the steps plus an explicit gap list. It never invents a missing link and
never resolves a conflict — a chain with gaps is returned *with its gaps shown*,
which is the point: the reader sees exactly where the inference is load-bearing
and where it is uncertain.

Pure stdlib; consumes atoms the NDs produce.
