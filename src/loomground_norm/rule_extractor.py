"""Rule extractor — Phase B2 (continued), EU-wide.

Once a fragment is classified as ``normative``, the rule extractor pulls
out its **operative structure** so downstream ND dispatchers can do real
work, not just see a type label.

Five operative slots per rule:

- **subject**: the regulated entity ("provider", "controller", "Tenant",
  "Der Verantwortliche", "le responsable", "il titolare").
- **modal**: deontic operator ("shall", "must not", "may", "muss",
  "dürfen nicht", "doit", "non può", "debe").
- **action**: what the subject is required / permitted / prohibited to do.
- **condition**: when the rule applies ("where", "if", "sofern", "si",
  "se", "indien", "jeżeli").
- **exception**: scoping carve-outs ("notwithstanding", "without prejudice
  to", "unbeschadet", "sans préjudice de", "fatto salvo").

The extractor is sentence-segmenting and returns one :class:`RuleFacet`
per detected rule. Whether a fragment is worth extracting from at all is a
separate, injectable decision (see ``fingerprint_gate`` on
:func:`extract_rules`) — a host with its own normative-fingerprint classifier
a host's routing layer wires it in; this module decides WHAT the
rules are, never WHETHER to look.

EU-wide coverage
----------------
Detection and extraction run over a per-language registry (``_PROFILES``)
covering the 24 official EU languages. English and German keep bespoke,
hand-tuned patterns (the indirect-operative-verb form, the German
``Wer``-clause). Every other language is driven by a generic
subject + modal + action builder parameterised by that language's deontic
verb table, determiners, and condition/exception connectives.

Confidence tiers for the deontic tables:
  TIER A (high)        en de fr it es nl pt sv da
  TIER B (medium)      pl cs sk ro sl hr el bg fi hu et
  TIER C (best-effort) lt lv ga mt   — recommend native-legal validation

A wrong or missing entry in a non-core table lowers *recall* (a candidate
rule is missed), it never fabricates a legal claim: extractor output is a
candidate, gated downstream by the confidence floor and the oversight dial.
This is still Phase-1 (regex); a Phase-2 local-LLM extractor is the planned
upgrade for embedded references and multi-sentence rule structures.
